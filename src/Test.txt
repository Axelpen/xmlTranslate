//oh god extracting every text from every node doesnt work,
//the deepL APi is too slow and limits requests after
//a while, especially when running them all at the same time.
//Next idea would be to just let DeepL API translate the whole
//document, change the Tags of the already translated paragraphs
//(using terminology) to something like "xexampletag", then 
//use the IgnoreTags Option from DeepL, 
//at the end removing the extra character from the tag so MSXSL works....
//god this sucks
